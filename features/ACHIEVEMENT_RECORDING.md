# Achievement Recording Implementation

This feature allows users to create short "achievement notes" to document positive moments or accomplishments with a simple text entry interface and visual feedback when adding to the jar.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Design feature architecture and user flow

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Create UI design for achievement entry screen
- [ ] Implement text entry field with character limit (150-200 chars)
- [ ] Design category selection component
- [ ] Create mood/emotion tag selector

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Implement date selection/override functionality
- [ ] Create "add to jar" animation
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Implement CoreData integration for storing achievements
- [ ] Create unit tests for achievement creation
- [ ] Add UI tests for achievement entry flow

## Implementation Plan

The Achievement Recording feature will be implemented using a MVVM pattern:

1. **Model**: Create Achievement data model with properties for text, category, mood, date, and unique identifier
2. **ViewModel**: Implement AchievementEntryViewModel to handle validation, character counting, and data persistence
3. **View**: Design AchievementEntryView with text input, category buttons, mood selector, and submit button
4. **Animation**: Create custom animation for when achievement is added to jar
5. **Data Layer**: Implement Repository pattern to abstract CoreData operations

### User Flow
1. User taps "Add Achievement" from main screen
2. Achievement entry screen appears with text field focused
3. User enters achievement text (with character counter)
4. User selects optional category and mood/emotion
5. User taps "Save" button
6. Validation occurs
7. Animation shows achievement being added to jar
8. User is returned to main screen with success feedback

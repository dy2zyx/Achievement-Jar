# Achievement Jar Storage Implementation

This feature provides a visually appealing jar that stores all achievements, with animations and visual feedback as the jar fills up with achievements over time.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Research jar visualization techniques and animation approaches

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Design jar visualization concept with Ghibli-inspired aesthetic
- [ ] Create basic jar UI component
- [ ] Implement jar filling visualization logic

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Create smooth animations for jar interactions
- [ ] Design visual indicators for jar fullness
- [ ] Implement achievement counter display
- [ ] Create particle effects for jar glow/highlighting
- [ ] Implement jar interaction gestures (shake, tap, etc.)
- [ ] Design achievement density visualization
- [ ] Add jar customization options (Phase 3)
- [ ] Create unit tests for jar visualization logic
- [ ] Add UI tests for jar interactions

## Implementation Plan

The Achievement Jar Storage feature will be the visual centerpiece of the app, implemented with a focus on delightful animations and visual feedback:

1. **Jar Visualization**: Create a beautiful, Ghibli-inspired jar design with transparency to show contents
2. **Fill Mechanics**: Implement dynamic fill level based on achievement count
3. **Achievement Representation**: Design how individual achievements appear within the jar
4. **Animations**: Create smooth animations for adding to and retrieving from the jar
5. **Interaction**: Implement gesture recognizers for jar interaction

### Technical Approach
- Use Core Animation for smooth, performant animations
- Implement custom path drawing for the jar shape
- Use SpriteKit for particle effects if needed
- Create reusable animation components for jar interactions
- Optimize rendering for performance

### User Interactions
- Tap jar to see brief stats about achievements
- Long press to manually retrieve a random achievement
- Shake phone to "stir" achievements (visual effect)
- Pinch to zoom in and see achievement details

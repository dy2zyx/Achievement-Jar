# Achievement Jar - Development Plan

This document outlines the structured approach to developing the Achievement Jar iOS application, a personal achievement time capsule with a Ghibli-inspired aesthetic.

## Project Overview

Achievement Jar allows users to:
- Record life's small joys and accomplishments as "achievement notes"
- Store them in a virtual jar
- Periodically retrieve notes randomly for review
- Maintain a positive mindset and appreciate personal growth

## Development Phases

The project will be developed in three main phases:

### Phase 1: MVP (4-6 weeks)

- Core achievement creation and storage
- Basic jar visualization
- Simple achievement retrieval
- Local data storage

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience (4-6 weeks)

- Improved animations and transitions
- Statistics dashboard
- Categories and filtering
- Notification system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (4-6 weeks)

- iCloud sync
- Advanced statistics
- Shareable achievements
- Additional customization options

## Technical Architecture

- **Architecture Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI with UIKit for complex animations
- **Reactive Programming**: Combine framework
- **Persistence**: CoreData with CloudKit integration (Phase 3)
- **Approach**: Protocol-oriented programming for flexibility

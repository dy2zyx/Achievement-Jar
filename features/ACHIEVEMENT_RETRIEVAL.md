# Achievement Retrieval Implementation

This feature implements a system for randomly pulling past achievements for review, with both automatic and manual retrieval options and delightful animations.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Design feature concept and user flow

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Design retrieval algorithm requirements
- [ ] Create UI mockup for retrieved achievement display
- [ ] Define retrieval frequency options

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Implement random selection algorithm with non-repetition
- [ ] Create daily retrieval scheduler
- [ ] Design and implement retrieval animation
- [ ] Build retrieved achievement detail view
- [ ] Add manual retrieval trigger gesture
- [ ] Implement notification for daily retrieval
- [ ] Create retrieval history tracking
- [ ] Add reflection/note option for retrieved achievements
- [ ] Create unit tests for retrieval algorithm
- [ ] Add UI tests for retrieval interaction

## Implementation Plan

The Achievement Retrieval feature will provide users with a delightful way to rediscover their past achievements:

1. **Retrieval Algorithm**: Implement weighted random selection with recency bias
2. **Scheduling**: Create a configurable schedule for automatic retrievals
3. **Notification**: Implement notifications for scheduled retrievals
4. **Animation**: Design beautiful animation for retrieving from jar
5. **Presentation**: Create engaging UI for displaying retrieved achievements

### Retrieval Algorithm Requirements
- Truly random selection but with non-repetition guarantees
- Configurable weighting based on achievement age (optional)
- Category-based retrieval options (future enhancement)
- Tracking of previously retrieved items
- Automatic reset of "viewed" status after certain period

### User Flow
1. User receives notification that an achievement was retrieved (if scheduled)
2. User opens app to see highlighted retrieved achievement
3. Achievement is displayed with original date and any categories/tags
4. User can add a reflection on how they feel about this achievement now
5. User can manually trigger another retrieval if desired

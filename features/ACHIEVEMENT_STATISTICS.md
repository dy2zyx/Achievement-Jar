## Implementation Plan

The Achievement Statistics feature will provide beautiful and insightful visualizations of the user's achievement patterns:

1. **Achievement Count**: Visualize daily/weekly/monthly/yearly achievement entry frequency
2. **Category Analysis**: Display distribution of achievements across categories
3. **Emotional Trends**: Show patterns in mood/emotion tags over time
4. **Consistency Tracking**: Highlight streaks and consistent periods
5. **Custom Analysis**: Allow selection of time periods and metrics for personalized insights

### Visualization Types

#### Time-based Charts
- Daily achievement counts
- Weekly/monthly achievement trends
- Rolling averages
- Comparison to previous periods

#### Distribution Charts
- Category pie/donut chart
- Mood/emotion distribution
- Time-of-day patterns
- Day-of-week patterns

#### Streak Tracking
- Current streak visualization
- Historical best streaks
- Calendar heat map
- Achievement milestone celebrations

### Technical Approach
- Use Swift Charts for core visualizations
- Implement custom drawing for watercolor-style effects
- Create reusable chart components with Ghibli-inspired styling
- Optimize data aggregation for performance
- Implement caching for chart data
